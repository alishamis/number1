# number1
This project aims to work as a simple file finder. Currently it has two main commands, a list command and a quit command. 
The user can denotes these when asked for input by either using the letter 'L' or 'Q", respectively. The user also needs to input a directory 
from which to find the files. The 'L" function will simply list out all the files in the directory. However, the L function also has 4 more commands, "-r", "-f", "-s", and "-e". 
These commands make the program output more specific files, excluding certain directories, printing all of them, printing files with a specific key word or extension.
The quit function is much more simpler, it simply exits the program.
